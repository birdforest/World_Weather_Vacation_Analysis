# World_Weather_Vacation_Analysis
Challenge 6
- WeatherPy: api key obtained from OpenWeatherMap.
- VacationPy: api key obtained from Geoapify.
- VacationPy: Instructor assisted with displaying the map because nothing was showing for me after I scaled the city points using "Humidity" (color="Scaled_Humidity") and TA assisted with displaying the hotels on the map with hover message. My original approach was using gv (Geoview) while the TA used hvplot. My approach is left in the code while being commented out.
- The api_keys.py is hidden. I followed step-by-step from the lecture video with instructor's demonstration.
